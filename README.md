## Requirements
    The system is expected to accept invoices as images, PDFs or using a web form. The invoices should be stored in the DB to be later used in the views.

    The system should have / Support:
    A login screen.
    A signup screen.
    A Dashboard that contains a paginated table that contains the invoice ordered by the latest created (paginated over 10 per page).
    A view to create a new invoice (this shall handle the three types of invoices).
    A view to edit / replace the invoice.
    A view to preview the invoice details.
    The user should be able to delete an invoice.
    Search invoices using form data OR other available metadata about uploaded files.
    Track invoice’s changes. And view it through certain privileged user(s).
    Support User / Superuser / Auditor roles, Superuser can perform all actions on all invoices in the system. While the user can manage his data only. Auditors can only view data (invoices) of all users without ability to change / delete any content.

    You are expected to:
    Design and implement a database model to best describe our case.
    Design and implement all the required web APIs.
    Use angular framework for the frontend size (functional and user friendly UI is expected)
    Handle the security correctly.
    Get all the data using API calls (Ajax), don’t load the data using the full stack framework.
    Localhost your application.
    Do a presentation explaining your DB / API / functional designs and assumptions.


    Don’t forget to:
    Do Logging!
    Do Exception handling
    Do Code documentation
